If you want to receive latest updates to my repositories, change the git link from github to codeberg, like so:

https://github.com/alexlnkp/sharedmem to https://codeberg.org/alexlnkp/sharedmem

i.e. just use this regex pattern: `https://github\.com/([^/]+/[^/]+)` and construct replacement using: `https://codeberg.org/$1`

It is with a heavy heart that I drop github, i liked this website... until microsoft bought it and turned it into an absolute shithole.
If you check github's "latest news" section - it's full of news about the fucking copilot and whatnot. As i'm writing this, there's THIS SHIT

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d759028-719e-447e-a308-232192d2f9ff)

that you can only get rid of using uBlock and custom filters, which are kind of hard to setup, considering that most of these fucking
ads github embeds use the same classes as **ACTUALLY FUNCTIONAL** elements.

Take for example, https://github.com/explore

![fuckyou](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9aacbe30-7396-46ad-9eae-bca62dbf3128)

Pay attention to the class of this obvious ad. It's identical to an actual article/recommendation. You can't uBlock this shit.


And also your code repositories are all being trained on for free, and that is
allowed by the terms which you _technically_ agreed to. I opted to use the [AI-forbidding licenses](https://github.com/non-ai-licenses/non-ai-licenses),
but those technically wont be enforceable for **GITHUB** repositories, as the clauses conflict with the ruleset, so to speak.

I will keep trying to contribute to projects on github, but as far as making new projects - that's for codeberg now.

I'll remove as much of my older projects as possible off github. Those will always be available on codeberg. I apologize for inconvenience.
