<h1 align="center"><a href = "https://codeberg.org/alexlnkp">I've moved to codeberg</a></h1>

If you want to receive latest updates to my repositories, change the git link from github to codeberg, like so:

https://github.com/alexlnkp/sharedmem to https://codeberg.org/alexlnkp/sharedmem

i.e. just use this regex pattern: `https://github\.com/([^/]+/[^/]+)` and construct replacement using: `https://codeberg.org/$1`

I'll remove as much of my older projects as possible off github. Those will always be available on codeberg. I apologize for inconvenience.
